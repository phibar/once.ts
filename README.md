# **O**bject **N**etwork **C**ommunication **E**ngine a [M2M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_to_machine) kernel
ONCE will become a M2M kernel, which means it will run on many different devices on different plattforms. First start will be running as a server on [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) or [Deno](https://deno.land) a client in Browser or Progressive Web App.
## Why would you need ONCE
Start any software by draging it onto any device. Just like on the bride of Star Trek Vessel Enterprise from TNG.
And if you do not want to wait for that star time...clone ths Git repo once now.
## What is ONCE
once.ts ist the Typescript implementaion of the first ever machine to machine kernel, that runs in any browser and everywhere you can access JavaScript. it works on node, deno and even exists in some more native languages soon.
ONCE means "Object Network Communication Engine" and enables distributed objects to communicate between any device with an internet access and even move freely from device to device.
## Project setup
Through the setup of ONCE all steps will be documented. Therefor the [Setup Notes](/documentation/setup-notes.md) document is created an kept updated. This should show you the evolution of the project and document the architectual decissions.
